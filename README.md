# Sepsis Prediction
Sepsis is the bodyâ€™s extreme response to an infection. It is a life-threatening medical emergency.

In this project, we want to build a machine learning model that predicts the probabilty of getting sepsis based on the patients' medical information. 

## Machine Learning Models
- XGBoot * (Best)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- AUC Score
- ROC Curve

## Dataset
- MIMIC III

## Prediction
- Independent variable: admission_location, insurance, religion, maritial_status, ethnicity, los, gender, age
- Dependent variable: is_sepsis(icd9_code)
