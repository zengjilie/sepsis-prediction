# Sepsis Prediction
We want to predict a patient's probabilty of getting sepsis based on variablle attributes
In this project, we used MIMIC III Clinical Dataset and compare multiple classification models on their performanceof classifing sepsis/non-sepsis

## Machine Learning Models
- XGBoot * Best
- logistic regression
- Random Forest

## Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- AUC Score
- ROC Curve

## Dataset
- MIMIC III

## Prediction
- Independent variable: admission_location, insurance, religion, maritial_status, ethnicity, los, gender, age
- Dependent variable: is_sepsis(icd9_code)
